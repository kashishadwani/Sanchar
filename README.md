# **Sanchar - a seamless video and audio calling app! ðŸ“±âœ¨**

## ðŸ”¹Inspiration:
So in the summer break of my 2nd year of b.tech , one day me and my mom were speaking to my Uncle ( mom's brother) who lives out of india, over facetime and my mom's neice was showing us some toy of her's with great excitement. Due to bad quality of the call we weren't able to communicate with them well. Now since IST calls come with hefty bills we brown families never use them unless it's a life risking urgency and so we opted to end the call with immense dissappointment that due to distance and bad quality calling platforms, we aren't able to speak to our loved ones, whenever and from wherever. That night i sat and researched ways to build one such platform on my own with excellent video quality & user-friendly interface and in a week i built this app. Was confused about the name as i wanted it to convey my intentions of never-interrupted communication, and then my dad came to my rescue and suggested **SANCHAR**.
